# Hi, there ðŸ˜Ž
### Welcome to my profile!

I'm a computer science student focused on writing clean code.
I take photos, make videos, and have a keen interest 
in data processing and image editing. I also build bots 
for managing groups on Telegram and Discord.
On this profile, youâ€™ll find some of my projects 
created with the tech stack listed below.
There are also a few examples showcasing the somewhat exotic ExtendScript,
which allows for modifying Adobe Creative Cloud applications.
